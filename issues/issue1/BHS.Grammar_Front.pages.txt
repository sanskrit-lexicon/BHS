<H>BIBLIOGRAPHY AND ABBREVIATIONS
THE BHS TEXTS fall roughly into three main classes, as regards their language. These may possibly, if only loosely, represent successive chronological layers in the tradition. It must be emphasized, however, that such a chronological classification does not necessarily apply to the original composition of the texts in question, but only to the forms in which they are now preserved to us. Some of them are known to have undergone changes, always in the direction of greater Sanskritization (see §§ 1.39 ff.; note for example the facts about Vaj, § 1.41, which is put in my third class). Winternitz (Hist. Ind. Lit. 2.314) holds that the Prajñā-Pāramitās ‘belong to the earliest Mahāyāna-Sūtras .. . A Prajnā-Pāramitā was already translated into Chinese as early as 179 A.D.’ Yet AsP and ŚsP, the two works of this class which I have included, belong linguistically in my third class, in the forms now preserved to us; they contain practically no verses, and very little non-Sanskrit morphology.
1. The first class consists only of Mv, plus a short citation from the lost Bhikṣuprakīrṇaka (in Śikṣ), and a short Jātaka printed in the Appendix to Jm. In these works, the prose parts are thoroughly hybridized, showing as many Middle-Indicisms as the verses. In its ‘nucleus’, at least, Mv seems to be the oldest BHS text we have; and this linguistic type is surely older than the other two.
2. In the second class, the verses are hybridized, as in the first class, but the prose contains relatively few signs of Middle Indic phonology or morphology. However, the vocabulary, at least, stamps even the prose as BHS. In this class belong SP, LV, Gv (including Bhad), KP, Dbh, RP, Sukh, Samādh, Suv, Ud (contains no prose), and nearly all of Śikṣ (which consists mainly of quotations from older texts, many of which are not otherwise preserved).
3. In the third class, even the verses (if any; some of these texts contain few or none; those which have none could be included in the second class) are substantially as Sanskritized as the prose parts; the entire text of these works resembles linguistically the prose parts of the second class. That is, non-Sanskritic forms are not common; the vocabulary is the clearest evidence that they belong to the BHS tradition. These include MSV, Divy, Av, Prāt, Mmk, Bbh, AsP, ŚsP, Māy, Bhīk, Karmav, Kv, Laṅk, Vaj, and Jm; here belong also the vocabulary lists in Dharmas and Mvy, and most of the miscellaneous short texts collected in Sādh, so far as they are not standard Sanskrit, which not a few of them seem to be.

Unfortunately this valuable series came to hand so late in the progress of my task that I felt it impossible to include Volumes 1 and 2, which seem somewhat less important.
Mv	= Mahāvastu, ed. Senart, Paris, 1882, 1890, 1897. The first volume of Jones's translation (London, 1949) appeared, to my regret, too late to be much used (I received it in 1950).

Cited by numbered entries in ed. of Sakaki, Kyoto, 1916, with Sanskrit and Tibetan Indexes, 1925 and 1936; some variants are cited from Mironov (2d ed. of Minaeff, which is cited in BR and pw), St. Petersburg, 1910—11.

Tibetan citations chiefly from block-print in my possession, partly from WT. When my work was practically ready for print, my colleague Professor Rahder received, and lent to me, the photostatic reproduction of the ms. referred to by WT as Ḱ. It has been cited a very few times. The quotations from it in WT seem to be very inaccurate.
ŚsP	= Śatasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā, ed. P. Ghoṣa, Bibliotheca Indica, Calcutta, 1902 ff.
Sukh	= Sukhāvatīvyūha (‘Larger’ and ‘Smaller’), ed. Müller, Oxford, 1883.

Suv	= Suvarṇabhāsottamasūtra, ed. Nobel, Leipzig, 1937; Tibetan version, ed. same, Leiden and Stuttgart, 1944.
Svay = (Vṛhat-)Svayambhū Purāṇa, ed. Haraprasad Sastri, Calcutta, 1894—1900; of very little use and only rarely cited. Cf. Winternitz, Hist. Ind. Lit. II, 376, note.

m.c.	= metri causa. I include under this term two classes of cases, because in both I find evidence for believing that metrical considerations were either the exclusive or the dominant reason for the use of the form in question. The first includes any cases of a particular form which is never used in prose, or in positions in a verse where the alternative (‘regular’) form would fit as well. The second includes cases in which the form labelled ‘m.c.’ is indeed also used (elsewhere) in prose or metrically indifferent positions, but in such limited or specialized ways (which vary in different cases) that I still believe the choice was determined, in the cases under consideration where the term ‘m.c.’ occurs, by meter. In both types, of course, the alternative (‘regular’) form would be impossible in a specific context where it is labelled ‘m.c.’ It is hoped that my manner of presentation will make it easy to distinguish the two types. Frequency of occurrence, and use of corresponding forms in other MIndic dialects, are important considerations to which I have tried to give due weight.

()	Parentheses, in the Dictionary, enclose articles on words which occur in standard Skt. in substantially the same meanings as in BHS, but which by exception, for one reason or another, seem to need treatment here. The reason is usually a (previous) erroneous interpretation, or sometimes what is felt to be a danger thereof.
[ ]	Brackets, in the Dictionary, enclose articles on what are considered erroneous readings. They are, however, also used in the interior of an article, in lieu of parentheses which, if used, would fall within other parentheses.
